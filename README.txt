This .zip file contains 6 files: 

1. README.txt, this text file you are reading right now
2. SDS 235 HW3 Final Report.pdf, the pdf which contains the visualizations and the report to present to the “sponsor”
3. Sketches.pdf, a pdf file of our visualization sketches
4. traffic_visualizations.ipynb, python code used to generate the visualizations for the traffic data
5. sensor_vis.qmd, R code used to generate the visualizations for the sensor data
6. Homework 3 Reflection.pdf, a pdf file with our reflection on the assignment


Instructions:
Please place all submitted files in the same directory as the hw03-data folder so that the codes can be run
To run the Python code, open the traffic_visualizations.ipynb file in Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook. It is recommended to have your window wider to have a better viewing experience. Install all the packages in the terminal using “pip install package-name”. Then, you will be able to run all Python codes and see the interactive map at the bottom. Uncomment to visualize a specific date's communication information, either displayed in their original communication times or separated into 5-minute intervals for the purpose of clearness and readability. Please comment the line back before uncommenting the next plot. Click on any time point on the time series plot and you will see the specific sender-receiver information in the network plot and the table. 
To run the R code, open the sensor_vis.qmd file in RStudio. Install all the packages and you will be able to knit the file. Alternatively, you can run through the code chunk by chunk and view the visualizations with interactive capabilities in your browser by popping them out of the RStudio viewer.
